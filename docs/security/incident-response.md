## Incident Response Team

The Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) consists of:

- **Security Lead**: Responsible for overall coordination of the incident response
- **Technical Lead**: Responsible for technical investigation and remediation
- **Communications Lead**: Responsible for internal and external communications
- **Legal Advisor**: Provides guidance on legal implications and requirements
- **Executive Sponsor**: Provides executive oversight and decision-making authority

Contact information for the SIRT is maintained in the secure team directory and should be kept up-to-date.

## Incident Classification

Security incidents are classified based on severity:

### Level 1 (Critical)
- Unauthorized access to user data
- Compromise of authentication systems
- Data breach affecting multiple users
- Malicious code in production systems

### Level 2 (High)
- Suspected unauthorized access
- Denial of service affecting critical functionality
- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities
- Unusual system behavior indicating potential compromise

### Level 3 (Medium)
- Suspicious activity requiring investigation
- Minor security policy violations
- Isolated security misconfigurations
- Potential vulnerabilities discovered in non-critical systems

### Level 4 (Low)
- Security events with minimal impact
- Policy violations with no immediate security impact
- Failed attack attempts detected by monitoring systems

## Response Phases

### 1. Preparation
- Maintain up-to-date contact information for the SIRT
- Ensure access to necessary tools and resources
- Regularly review and update incident response procedures
- Conduct periodic training and simulations

### 2. Identification
- Receive and validate incident reports
- Gather initial information about the incident
- Classify the incident severity
- Notify appropriate SIRT members
- Create an incident ticket to track all activities

### 3. Containment
- Implement immediate containment measures to limit damage
- Isolate affected systems if necessary
- Preserve evidence for later analysis
- Document all containment actions taken

#### Short-term Containment
- Block malicious IP addresses
- Disable compromised accounts
- Take affected systems offline if necessary
- Implement emergency patches or configuration changes

#### Long-term Containment
- Apply patches to all affected systems
- Update security configurations
- Strengthen access controls
- Implement additional monitoring

### 4. Eradication
- Identify and remove the cause of the incident
- Scan systems for indicators of compromise
- Remove malicious code or unauthorized access points
- Validate that all malicious components have been removed

### 5. Recovery
- Restore systems to normal operation
- Verify system functionality
- Monitor for any signs of continued compromise
- Gradually return to normal operations

### 6. Lessons Learned
- Conduct a post-incident review meeting
- Document the incident and response activities
- Identify improvements to security controls
- Update incident response procedures based on lessons learned

## Communication Guidelines

### Internal Communication
- Use secure communication channels
- Provide regular updates to stakeholders
- Maintain confidentiality of incident details
- Document all communications

### External Communication
- All external communications must be approved by the Communications Lead
- Coordinate with Legal Advisor on disclosure requirements
- Prepare templates for user notifications if required
- Follow regulatory disclosure requirements

## Documentation Requirements

For each incident, document:

1. Date and time of discovery
2. Description of the incident
3. Systems and data affected
4. Actions taken during each response phase
5. Timeline of events
6. Evidence collected
7. Resolution and remediation steps
8. Lessons learned

## Post-Incident Activities

After resolving the incident:

1. Complete a comprehensive incident report
2. Update security controls based on findings
3. Revise incident response procedures if needed
4. Conduct additional training if required
5. Implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents

## Testing and Training

- Conduct quarterly tabletop exercises simulating different incident scenarios
- Perform annual full-scale incident response drills
- Provide regular training for all SIRT members
- Review and update this document at least annually
