# Progressive Enhancement for Capable Devices

This document describes the progressive enhancement system implemented in the evo-pro project, which enables enhanced features on capable devices while ensuring a good baseline experience on all devices.

## Overview

Progressive enhancement is a strategy that provides a baseline experience for all users while enhancing the experience for users with more capable devices. The evo-pro project implements this strategy by:

1. Detecting available system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network)
2. Determining the appropriate resource profile (HighEnd, MidRange, LowEnd, etc.)
3. Automatically enabling or disabling enhanced features based on the profile
4. Providing APIs for checking feature availability and manually overriding settings

## Resource Profiles

The system defines several resource profiles:

- **HighEnd**: Systems with abundant resources (8+ CPU cores, 16+ GB RAM)
- **MidRange**: Systems with moderate resources (4+ CPU cores, 8+ GB RAM)
- **LowEnd**: Systems with limited resources (2+ CPU cores, 4+ GB RAM)
- **Mobile**: Systems with very limited resources (< 2 CPU cores, < 4 GB RAM)
- **BatteryPowered**: Systems running on battery power
- **LimitedConnectivity**: Systems with limited network connectivity

## Enhanced Features

The following enhanced features can be enabled on capable devices:

| Feature | Description | Minimum Profile |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| HighResolutionAssets | High-resolution textures and images | MidRange |
| AdvancedVisualEffects | Advanced visual effects (shadows, reflections, etc.) | HighEnd |
| RealTimeUpdates | Real-time data updates | MidRange |
| BackgroundProcessing | Background data processing | LowEnd |
| PredictivePrefetching | Predictive prefetching of data | MidRange |
| AdvancedAnalytics | Advanced analytics and metrics | MidRange |
| MultiThreadedOperations | Multi-threaded operations | MidRange |
| HardwareAcceleration | Hardware acceleration | MidRange |

## Implementation Details

The progressive enhancement system consists of the following components:

### EnhancedFeature Enum

Defines the enhanced features that can be enabled on capable devices.

```rust
pub enum EnhancedFeature {
    HighResolutionAssets,
    AdvancedVisualEffects,
    RealTimeUpdates,
    BackgroundProcessing,
    PredictivePrefetching,
    AdvancedAnalytics,
    MultiThreadedOperations,
    HardwareAcceleration,
    Custom(String),
}
```

### EnhancementManager

Manages the enabled features and their parameters.

```rust
pub struct EnhancementManager {
    enabled_features: HashMap<EnhancedFeature, bool>,
    feature_params: HashMap<EnhancedFeature, HashMap<String, String>>,
}
```

### Global Functions

The system provides the following global functions:

- `is_feature_enabled(feature: EnhancedFeature) -> bool`: Check if a feature is enabled
- `get_enabled_features() -> Vec<EnhancedFeature>`: Get all enabled features
- `force_enable_feature(feature: EnhancedFeature)`: Force enable a feature
- `force_disable_feature(feature: EnhancedFeature)`: Force disable a feature

## Usage

### Checking if a Feature is Enabled

```rust
use crate::resources::{EnhancedFeature, is_feature_enabled};

if is_feature_enabled(EnhancedFeature::HighResolutionAssets) {
    // Load high-resolution assets
} else {
    // Load standard-resolution assets
}
```

### Using Progressive Enhancement in UI Components

```rust
fn render_component() -> Element {
    let mut component = Component::new();
    
    // Add basic functionality for all devices
    component.add_basic_functionality();
    
    // Add enhanced functionality for capable devices
    if is_feature_enabled(EnhancedFeature::AdvancedVisualEffects) {
        component.add_advanced_effects();
    }
    
    component.into()
}
```

### Overriding Feature Settings

```rust
use crate::resources::{EnhancedFeature, force_enable_feature, force_disable_feature};

// Enable a feature regardless of resource profile (e.g., based on user preference)
force_enable_feature(EnhancedFeature::HighResolutionAssets);

// Disable a feature regardless of resource profile (e.g., to save battery)
force_disable_feature(EnhancedFeature::BackgroundProcessing);
```

## Best Practices

When implementing progressive enhancement, follow these best practices:

1. **Provide a Good Baseline Experience**: Ensure the application works well on all devices, even with all enhanced features disabled.

2. **Use Feature Detection**: Check if a feature is enabled before using it, rather than checking the resource profile directly.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Design features to gracefully degrade when not available, rather than failing or showing errors.

4. **User Control**: Allow users to override feature settings based on their preferences.

5. **Performance Testing**: Test the application with different resource profiles to ensure good performance across all devices.

## Integration with Adaptation System

The progressive enhancement system is integrated with the resource adaptation system:

1. The resource detector monitors system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network)
2. The resource manager determines the appropriate resource profile
3. The enhancement manager enables or disables features based on the profile
4. The application checks feature availability before using enhanced features

This integration ensures that the application automatically adapts to the capabilities of the device it's running on, providing the best possible experience for each user.
