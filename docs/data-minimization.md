# Data Minimization Strategies

This document outlines the data minimization strategies implemented in the evo-pro project to ensure privacy by default and compliance with privacy regulations.

## Overview

Data minimization is a principle that involves collecting and storing only the data that is necessary for the specific purpose, and not keeping it longer than necessary. The evo-pro project implements several strategies to minimize data collection and storage:

1. **Data Anonymization**: Replacing sensitive information with anonymized versions
2. **Data Retention Policies**: Automatically removing data after a certain period
3. **Purpose-Based Data Collection**: Providing different levels of data based on the purpose
4. **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Automatically redacting sensitive information in content

## Implementation Details

### Data Anonymization

The `DataMinimizationService` provides methods to anonymize sensitive user data:

- **Email Anonymization**: Keeps only the first character of the username part of the email address
  - Example: `john.doe@example.com` becomes `j******@example.com`

- **Phone Number Anonymization**: Keeps only the last 4 digits of the phone number
  - Example: `123-456-7890` becomes `*******7890`

- **Name Anonymization**: Keeps only the first character of first and last names
  - Example: `John Doe` becomes `J. D.`

- **Metadata Cleaning**: Removes sensitive fields from metadata objects
  - Sensitive fields include: address, location, date of birth, social security numbers, etc.

### Data Retention Policies

The service implements automatic data retention policies:

- **Message Retention**: Messages older than a configurable number of days are automatically deleted
- **User Data Retention**: For inactive users, personal data is anonymized rather than deleted
- **Scheduled Cleanup**: Retention policies can be applied on a schedule using the `apply_retention_policy` method

### Purpose-Based Data Collection

The service provides methods to return only the necessary data for a specific purpose:

- **Display Purpose**: Returns only basic display information (ID, display name, avatar URL, status)
- **Messaging Purpose**: Returns contact information but not full details
- **Profile Purpose**: Returns more details but still minimizes sensitive information
- **Default**: Returns minimal information (ID, display name)

### Sensitive Data Redaction

The service automatically redacts sensitive information in message content:

- **Email Addresses**: Replaced with `[EMAIL REDACTED]`
- **Phone Numbers**: Replaced with `[PHONE REDACTED]`
- **Social Security Numbers**: Replaced with `[SSN REDACTED]`
- **Credit Card Numbers**: Replaced with `[CREDIT CARD REDACTED]`

## Usage

### Anonymizing User Data

```rust
let mut user = db.get_user_by_id(&user_id).await?.unwrap();
let data_minimization_service = DataMinimizationService::new(db.clone());
data_minimization_service.anonymize_user(&mut user).await?;
```

### Applying Data Retention Policies

```rust
// Delete messages older than 90 days and anonymize inactive users
let data_minimization_service = DataMinimizationService::new(db.clone());
data_minimization_service.apply_retention_policy(90).await?;
```

### Getting Minimized User Data

```rust
// Get only the data necessary for displaying a user in the UI
let data_minimization_service = DataMinimizationService::new(db.clone());
let user_data = data_minimization_service.get_minimized_user(&user_id, "display").await?;
```

### Anonymizing Message Content

```rust
let mut message = db.get_message_by_id(&message_id).await?.unwrap();
let data_minimization_service = DataMinimizationService::new(db.clone());
data_minimization_service.anonymize_message(&mut message).await?;
```

## Best Practices

When implementing new features or modifying existing ones, follow these best practices:

1. **Collect Only What's Necessary**: Only collect data that is essential for the feature
2. **Minimize Storage Duration**: Set appropriate retention periods for different types of data
3. **Use Purpose-Based Access**: Only access the minimum data needed for a specific purpose
4. **Anonymize When Possible**: Use anonymization for analytics and non-personal use cases
5. **Document Data Usage**: Clearly document what data is collected and how it's used

## Compliance Considerations

The data minimization strategies implemented in evo-pro help comply with privacy regulations such as:

- **GDPR Article 5(1)(c)**: Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
- **CCPA**: Businesses should collect only the personal information reasonably necessary for the purposes disclosed
- **Privacy by Design**: Building privacy into the design of systems, processes, and products
