# Frontend & Backend Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines suggestions for improving the frontend and backend codebase of the Evo Design application.

## Frontend (React + Vite)

### 1. Centralize State Management

Currently, the state is managed within individual components using `useState` and `useEffect`. For a more complex application, it would be beneficial to use a centralized state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.

**Benefits:**

- **Single Source of Truth:** Simplifies state management and debugging.
- **Improved Performance:** Reduces re-renders by allowing components to subscribe to only the state they need.
- **Better Organization:** Separates state logic from UI components.

### 2. Create a Generic Chat Component

The current implementation lacks a reusable chat component. Creating a generic `ChatView` component would allow for easy implementation of both user-to-user and user-to-agent chat, with support for streaming messages.

**Features:**

- **Message Display:** Should be able to render different message types (text, images, etc.).
- **Message Input:** A flexible input component that can handle text, attachments, and commands.
- **Streaming Support:** The component should be able to handle real-time message updates and streaming.

### 3. Enhance the API Hooks

The existing API hooks are well-structured, but they could be enhanced with additional features.

**Suggestions:**

- **Optimistic Updates:** For a more responsive UI, implement optimistic updates for mutations like creating and updating messages.
- **Real-time Updates:** Integrate real-time event handling directly into the `useQuery` and `useListQuery` hooks to automatically update the data when an event is received.

## Backend (Rust + Tauri)

### 1. Implement a More Robust Authentication and Authorization System

The current `AuthContext` is a good starting point, but a more comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system would be beneficial.

**Suggestions:**

- **Permissions:** Define a set of permissions that can be assigned to roles (e.g., `create_message`, `delete_conversation`).
- **Role Management:** Create a system for managing roles and assigning them to users.
- **Middleware:** Use middleware to check permissions at the API endpoint level.

### 2. Refine the Service Layer

The service layer is well-designed, but there are opportunities for refinement.

**Suggestions:**

- **Error Handling:** Use a more structured error type that can be easily serialized and sent to the frontend.
- **Transaction Management:** Implement a more robust transaction management system to ensure data consistency across multiple database operations.
- **Service-Level Caching:** Introduce a caching layer at the service level to reduce database load and improve performance.

### 3. Improve the Actor System

The Kameo actor system provides a powerful concurrency model, but it could be enhanced for better observability and management.

**Suggestions:**

- **Actor Monitoring:** Implement a system for monitoring the health and performance of actors.
- **Message Tracing:** Add support for tracing messages as they flow through the actor system to help with debugging.
- **Dynamic Actor Scaling:** Explore options for dynamically scaling the number of actors based on workload.
