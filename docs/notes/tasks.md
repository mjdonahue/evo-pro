1.  What is a secure and user-friendly approach to retrieving and sharing users libp2p peer ids after intalling native tauri rust app for the first time so they can engage in a direct message chat.

2. In tauri v2 rust using sqlite and sqlx, what is the best approach to seeding the database with initial data the first time they run the app. The approach should support an easy way to edit and update during the developement process.

3. Is there a way to get/share an id of some type that could be used for automatically discovering the users peers if they change devices etc.
