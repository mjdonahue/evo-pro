# Privacy Impact Assessment Template

## Overview

This document provides a template for conducting Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for new features or changes to the evo-pro application. PIAs help identify and mitigate privacy risks before they occur.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Privacy Impact Assessment is to:
1. Identify what personal data will be collected, processed, or stored
2. Evaluate privacy risks associated with the proposed changes
3. Determine appropriate privacy controls and mitigation strategies
4. Ensure compliance with privacy regulations and best practices
5. Document privacy-related decisions for future reference
