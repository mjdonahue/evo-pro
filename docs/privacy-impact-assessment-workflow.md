# Privacy Impact Assessment Workflow

This document describes the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) workflow implemented in the evo-pro project to ensure privacy considerations are integrated into the development process.

## Overview

Privacy Impact Assessments are a systematic process to identify and mitigate privacy risks associated with new features or changes to existing features. The evo-pro project has implemented an automated workflow to ensure PIAs are conducted when necessary.

## Workflow Components

The PIA workflow consists of the following components:

1. **PIA Template**: A standardized template for conducting privacy assessments
2. **PIA Directory**: A central location for storing and reviewing PIAs
3. **Automated Checks**: Pre-commit hooks that enforce PIA creation for privacy-sensitive changes
4. **Documentation**: Guidelines and examples for creating effective PIAs

## How the Workflow Works

### 1. Identifying Privacy-Sensitive Changes

The system automatically identifies changes to privacy-sensitive files and directories, including:

- User data-related code
- Message data-related code
- Authentication-related code
- Data storage-related code
- Privacy-specific features

### 2. Enforcing PIA Creation

When a developer attempts to commit changes to privacy-sensitive files, the pre-commit hook runs a check to verify that:

- There is a reference to a PIA in the commit message (e.g., "PIA-123" or "Privacy Impact Assessment"), OR
- There is a recent PIA document in the `docs/privacy-impact-assessments` directory

If neither condition is met, the commit is blocked with a warning message that explains how to proceed.

### 3. Creating a PIA

To create a PIA:

1. Copy the template from `docs/templates/privacy-impact-assessment.md`
2. Create a new file in the `docs/privacy-impact-assessments` directory with a descriptive name
3. Fill out all sections of the template
4. Reference the PIA in your commit message

### 4. Reviewing PIAs

PIAs should be reviewed as part of the code review process. Reviewers should pay special attention to:

- Completeness of the assessment
- Accuracy of risk evaluations
- Effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies
- Compliance with relevant privacy regulations

## Bypassing the Check

In exceptional circumstances, the PIA check can be bypassed using the `--no-verify` flag with git commit:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

This should be done only when absolutely necessary and with appropriate justification. The team should follow up with a proper PIA as soon as possible.

## Example PIA

An example PIA for the Data Minimization Service can be found at `docs/privacy-impact-assessments/data-minimization-service-pia.md`. This example demonstrates how to complete a PIA for a feature that processes personal data.

## Benefits of the PIA Workflow

Integrating PIAs into the development workflow provides several benefits:

1. **Privacy by Design**: Ensures privacy considerations are addressed from the beginning
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps meet requirements of privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies and addresses privacy risks before they become issues
4. **Documentation**: Creates a record of privacy decisions and considerations
5. **Awareness**: Increases developer awareness of privacy implications

## Maintenance and Updates

The list of privacy-sensitive files and directories is maintained in the `scripts/privacy-check.js` file. This list should be updated as the codebase evolves to ensure all privacy-sensitive areas are covered.

The PIA template may also be updated over time to reflect changes in privacy best practices or regulatory requirements.
